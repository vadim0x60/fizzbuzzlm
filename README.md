# FizzBuzzLM

This repo is a research project to explore what is the most efficient implementation of the [fizz buzz algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz). Contenders:
- Python
- C
- Java
- Clojure
- Haskell
- Rust
- Go
- Javascript
- Rust
- A specialized LLM (Little Language Model) for FizzBuzz

The goal is to reiterate, with a little more scientific rigor, the point made in [Fizz-Buzz in Tensorflow](https://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/) by Joel Grus: programming languages tend to implement algorithms more efficiently, both in terms of information theory (less bytes of memory) and in terms of runtime.

## Reproducibility

Just run [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) (but first make sure all the programming languages are installed and available in your `PATH`).
